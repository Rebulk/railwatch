# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- Initial release: requests, jobs, scheduled tasks, commands, queries (with
  N+1 detection), transactions, exceptions, cache, mail, Action Cable
  broadcasts, Noticed notifications, outgoing HTTP, Active Storage, view
  renders, logs and Rails 8.1 structured events, deprecations, users,
  processes, and Inertia visits. Sampling, ignore/pause, redaction,
  rejection, before-ingest rate limiting, deploy tracking, Kamal hook.
- Job attempts report `status` (`released` when `retry_on` re-enqueues instead
  of failing), `queue_latency` measured at perform-start rather than after the
  job runs, `connection`, and `concurrency_key`; a pruned job attempt gets a
  fresh `execution_id`/`trace_id` instead of reusing a stale one.
- `process` records measure `boot_seconds` from `Lantern::BOOTED_AT`, a clock
  reading taken as early in process boot as Lantern can observe, instead of an
  unset global.
- `bin/rails runner` invocations are instrumented as a `command` execution.
- Inertia SSR renders are timed automatically (`inertia.ssr_ms`) wherever
  `inertia_rails` SSR is enabled, including full-page (non-XHR) visits.
- Exceptions report `code` (errno, for a `SystemCallError`) and `sql_state`.
- Transactions report `statement_count` (writes made inside the transaction)
  and a `group` hash for grouping in the UI.
- Default vendor rake tasks (`db:migrate`, `assets:precompile`, ...) and
  default vendor cache-key prefixes (`rack::attack`, `flipper`, ...) are
  excluded by default; opt back in with `capture_default_vendor_commands` /
  `capture_default_vendor_cache_keys`.
- `Lantern.reject_cache_keys` drops your own noisy cache keys the same way as
  the default vendor list, with trailing-`*` prefix matching and regex support.
- A request sampled out together with `sample[:exceptions] = 0` now ships
  nothing for an unhandled exception, instead of always shipping one.
- Requests report `route_methods`, `route_domain`, and uploaded `files`
  (name/size/content_type only, never file contents).
- `Lantern.on_unrecoverable` registers a callback for Lantern's own internal
  errors (a subscriber raising, or delivery failing after its retry).
- `Lantern::Faraday` middleware instruments outgoing HTTP made through
  Faraday (`f.use Lantern::Faraday`); `Lantern.instrument_outgoing(method,
  url) { }` covers any other HTTP client.
